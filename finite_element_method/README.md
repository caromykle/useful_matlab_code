# Finite Elements

## Problem

The files in this folder apply the FEM (Finite Elements Method) to the Poisson Problem
<p> - &Delta;(&Kappa; &Delta;) = f on &Omega;</p>
<p> &Kappa; = 2; </p>
<p> u(d &Omega;)=0; Dirichlet Boundary Conditions</p>

The error is calculated using the L<sub>2</sub> Norm by comparing to the analytical solution:
<p>1D: u(x)=x(1-x)</p>
<p>2D: u(x,y) =x(1-x)y(1-y)</p>

## General application
This code will also be valid for general problems.
